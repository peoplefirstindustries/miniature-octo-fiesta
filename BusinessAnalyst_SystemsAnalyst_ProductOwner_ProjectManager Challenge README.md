> **The Challenge** 

Theta has been tasked with developing a new 'News Feed' feature for a clients existing web application, but we haven't been given any real direction outside of a basic SOO.

Not helpful, right? Unfortunately, many systems design/architecture and application design tasks are very vague and can literally be given to us in the form of `Design Foobar.` 

As a member of Theta's functional team, it's your job to ask clarifying questions to understand better the system that your engineers and developers have to build.

Assume you'd have an engineer/developer/architect that you could work closely with for this discovery phase, your task is for you to draft and submit 6-10 clarifying questions you'd ask your client in which their answers could give us some guidance on how to solve their need or problem. 

**Mandatory Work:**

- Provide a write of the 6-10 questions you'd ask the client to elicit requirements, features, tasks, etc... to help formulate specs for engineers and developers to work off of.

**FAQS:**

**Q:** What will you be grading me on?

**A:** Cleverness, Communication Skills, Elegance of questions asked, understanding of the technologies your team would work with, security, documentation, etc...

**Q:** Will I have a chance to explain my choices?

**A:** Feel free to comment on your questions, or put explanations on why you are asking this question. If we proceed to a phone interview, weâ€™ll be asking questions about why you made the choices you made for questions you asked.

**Q:** Why doesn't the test include XY and Z?

**A:** Dope question! PLEASE free to tell us how to make the test better. Or, you know, fork it and improve it!
